# Game "Penguins" with GUI

This game relays on the GUI library called **Raylib** (https://www.raylib.com), which is cloned from GitHub during configuration.

Raylib uses **GLFW** library, for which additional installations might be necessary (see https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html).

**CMake** is also needed to build the project.

We have created Shell scripts to automate the process of configuring, building and running the game.

**To configure, run**
```sh
./configure
```

**To build, run**
```sh
./build
```

**To run, run**
```sh
./run
```

In case of using **Windows**, code inside above Shell scripts should be run manually and use CMake GUI app for building.
